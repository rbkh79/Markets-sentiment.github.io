# Market Sentiment Analysis Using Continual Learning

## Introduction
This project focuses on using Continual Learning to analyze market sentiment. Continual Learning, also known as Lifelong Learning, enables models to adapt to new data while preserving previously learned knowledge, making it ideal for applications where data is continuously generated, such as market sentiment analysis.

## Introduction to Continual Learning
Here, you will find an informal introduction to Continual Learning. For a comprehensive overview of the field, have a look at our research section, in which you can find in-depth surveys on the topic together with specific approaches and techniques to address the Continual Learning challenge.

### What is Continual / Lifelong Learning?
Continual Learning, also known as Lifelong learning, is built on the idea of learning continuously about the external world in order to enable the autonomous, incremental development of ever more complex skills and knowledge.

A Continual learning system can be defined as an adaptive algorithm capable of learning from a continuous stream of information, with such information becoming progressively available over time and where the number of tasks to be learned (e.g. membership classes in a classification task) are not predefined. Critically, the accommodation of new information should occur without catastrophic forgetting or interference.

Hence, in the Continual Learning scenario, a learning model is required to incrementally build and dynamically update internal representations as the distribution of tasks dynamically changes across its lifetime. Ideally, part of such internal representations will be general and invariant enough to be reusable across similar tasks, while another part should preserve and encode task-specific representations.

### The Deep Learning Approach to Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning in which models - artificial neural networks, in most of the cases - learn to map input to output by building an adaptive, internal hierarchical representation. Artificial neural networks are made of units linked together by weighted connections. The learning process is defined by changing the value of the weights in order to minimize a cost function which measures how much the output produced by the model differs from the expected outcome.

Such learning process is adaptive, meaning that it only requires a (possibly large) set of data from which to learn and a suitable cost function to specify the type of task to be performed.

Decades of research showed that Deep Learning models are able to accomplish a range of different tasks, often surpassing human-level performance. They are widespread in several fields like language translation, self-driving cars, bio-medical applications, stock prediction in financeâ€¦ just to name a few!

The astonishing accomplishments made by Deep Learning are confined to a specific task: without additional training, a Deep Learning neural network which is able to beat the (human) world champion at the game of Go will not be able to drive a car or to translate from English to French. However, nothing prevents us from continuing to train the network on new tasks.

What will be the behavior of the network at the end of the new learning phase? This question is at the heart of the Continual Learning field.

## Market Sentiment Analysis Using Continual Learning
In this project, we use Continual Learning to analyze market sentiment from various sources such as news articles, social media posts, and financial reports. Continual Learning allows our model to adapt to the ever-changing nature of market sentiment, making it a robust tool for financial analysis.

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from various sources like news, social media, and financial reports.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the data for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Train a Continual Learning model on the preprocessed data.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use the trained model to perform sentiment analysis on new data.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model and fine-tune as necessary.
